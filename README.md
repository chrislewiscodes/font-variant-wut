# CSS font-variant tester

A tool to test browser support for the various CSS font-variant rules.

The main page assesses whether your browser supports the various font-variant-… rules defined in CSS3. It uses a special test font, designed by [David Jonathan Ross](https://djr.com/), which uses OpenType features to display the name of the feature only when that feature is activated.

The page also records a report of your browser’s performance, in order to build a comprehensive listing of browser support for these bleeding-edge rules. No personally-identifying information is recorded.
